Problem solving for remotely access


If you got the same problem like this while connect to MySQL server from another host (It depends on which version of MySQL you are using):


java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Public Key Retrieval is not allowed


You should change your password of root user by using the native password hashing method to fix it:


```shell
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '123456';
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '123456';
```
